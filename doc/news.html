    <h1>What is new</h1>
    
    <h3>Version 3_1</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
	The distribution has been tuned for <tt>Linux</tt>;
      </li>
      <li>
	The complete source code is now available for download;
      </li>
      <li>
	The script to build the distribution is now based on <a href="http://ant.apache.org/index.html">Apache Ant</a> and
	is therefore platform independend;
      </li>
      <li>
	The <a href="bugs.html">bugs</a> in Version 3_0 are fixed.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Version 3_0</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>iTe will now also run on MS Windows platforms.
      </li>
      <li>A major code review took place.
      </li>
      <li>iTe does not use it's own HTML-browser anymore.</li>
      <li>The <a href="bugs.html">bugs</a> in Version 2_20 are fixed.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Version 2_20</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The <a href="bugs.html">bug</a> in Version 2_15 is fixed.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Version 2_15</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The <a href="bugs.html">bug</a> in the short-lived Version 2_1 is fixed.
      </li>
      <li>The test suite is now integrated in the online help and can also
	be accessed before installation using <code>make check</code>.
      </li>
      <li>The <span class=ite>iTe</span> web pages got a face lift.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Version 2_1</h3>
    <p>
      The perl module of iTe got an overhaul. It now handles included eps files
      which do not conform to the PostScript file description format (for example files generated by Matlab).
    </p>
    
    <h3>Version 2_01</h3>
    <p>
      This minor release fixes two <a href="bugs.html">bugs</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Version 2_0</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>All known <a href="bugs.html">bugs</a> are fixed.
      </li>
      <li>iTe is now much more user friendly. The package does include a help browser.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Version 1_3</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> 
	Known bugs are fixed.
      </li>
      <li>
	The local html-documentation is now accessed via
	<tt>doc/htmlmanual/index.html</tt>.
      </li>
      <li>
	There is a new tokenlist <tt>\everyite</tt>. Use it to insert tokens
	in every <tt>iteblock</tt> environment. Very useful to fix the size
	of the font, for example with
	<tt>\everyite={\fontsize{10}{12pt}\selectfont}</tt>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Version 1_2</h3>
    
    <p>
      The code is completely rewritten, cleaner, and better documented. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>Major impovements</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
	iTe teams up with AucTeX to process multiple files via a master file.
      </li>
      <li>
	iTe is not a minor mode anymore, but instead operates directly on
	objects with the help of text properties. Objects can be selected
	with the mouse.
      </li>
      <li>
	Handles even huge included eps-files. If the size of an
	eps-file exceeds a certain threshold, the user has the option
	to only display a bounding box.
      </li>
      <li>
	The dimensional argument (xdim,ydim) of the <em>iteblock</em>
	environment is now optional. If omitted, the block
	automatically adapts its size to include all of its objects.
      </li>
      <li>
	The parsing of the PostScript code is now done with Perl,
	not by (X)Emacs anymore. This improves speed and requires less
	memory.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p></p>
    
    <h3>Incompatibilities</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li> For LaTeX, iTe is now loaded via <tt>\usepackage{ite}</tt>,
	and <b>not</b> via <tt>\input ite</tt>.  
      </li>
      <li> The
	<tt>\grabber</tt> was impoved so that it now rotates about the
	center of the circle. This will cause small offsets for the old
	grabber.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Version 1_1</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
	Zooming now works also for scaled documents, for example documents
	which contain
	<pre>
\special{!userdict begin /bop-hook{0.5 0.5 scale} def end}
	</pre>
	Very useful for oversized paper sizes like posters.
      </li>
      <li>
	iTe block environments can now occur inside scaled boxes, for example
	<pre>
\scalebox{0.5}{%
\begin{iteblock}(\textwidth,8cm)
\ite\includegraphics{sc.eps}
\ite$\sin x$
\end{iteblock}}
	</pre>
	Note that <em>\scalebox</em> is defined in the <em>graphics</em> package.
      </li>
      <li>
	Bug due to incorrect scaling (thanks to Manuel H&ouml;l&szlig;).
      <li>
	Bug involving killed message window fixed (thanks to Jan Vroonhof).
      </li>
    </ul>
