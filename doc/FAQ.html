Subject: iTe bug

Hello!  I just ran the iTe demo and found what appears to 
be a bug.  After xemacs and ghostscript came up the cursor
started to change numbers in the document but the ghostscript
window remained blank for the entire demo.  Do you know why
this happened?

thanks,
Issac

ANSWER:

Hello,

I had a bug with these symptoms once, and I fixed it on all platforms
listed in the manual. Today I discovered that the demo does not run
with Emacs, but I fixed it. You are probably using XEmacs.  The demo
is a hard exercise for the Emacs-family, which is not really intended
for these kind of animations. If the example works via (see manual)

    > latex example.tex
    > xemacs -load ite.el

then iTe runs on your platform. If the example does not run, please let
me know. Otherwise, the demo isn't working for some strange emacs-internal
reason. But then it's just a demo.

QUESTION:

Thanks for your advice about iTe.  I'll give that a try.  In the
meantime, is there any way to use iTe without XEmacs?
I like to use vi to conserve memory.

ANSWER:

Of course you can use Emacs, which is somewhat smaller. 
iTe is mainly written in emacs-lisp, so vi will definitely
not do.

Dear Mr. Kühn.
 A few days ago I bekame a hint on your iTe. I think it's a great Idea
and it
makes  it very easy to create and maniplulate Graphics in TeX.
 I first had it running on a DEC-Workstation without problems but on my
linux-PC
(SuSE -Linux, Kernel 2.0.34, xemacx 20.4, devips 5.58, gv 4.03) it
behaved a little strange:

The blue box indicating the frame of the iteblock-environment and the
motion of the objects
in the gs-window have the double size, they should have.
The result of this is, that when a object is placed correctly in the
gs-window, the Numbers
in the argument change only half of the distance teh object was moved.
So rcompiling the tex-file
results in on output, where all the objects are moved back half the
distance they were moved.
Perhaps you have an Idea, where this problem may come from ? I'd be glad
if you could tell me.

An other point I wanted to mention is that there is an easy possibility
to work around one restriction
given in sect 13 of the manual. It's the point, that an iteblock may not
appere in includet files.
Just setting a symbolic link allows to use an iteblock in included
files:
>  ln -s <masterfile>.dvi <inputfile>.dvi
Perhaps it's not a very elegant way to solve the problem, but it works.


ANSWER

Hallo,

Die neuste Version (1.1) von iTe ist jetzt fertig. Bitte teilen Sie mir mit, ob der Fehler behoben ist.

Die von Ihnen vorgeschlagene Moeglichkeit, iteblock Umgebungen in
include files zu ermoeglichen, funktioniert so nicht. Die naechste
Version von iTe (nicht bis Anfang Oktober) wird aber Master und Slave-
files unterstuetzen.

Wow! nice idea, it is certainly cool.

However I found a bug/have a few remarks.

(iTe 1.0, XEmacs 21.0preX-mule or XEmacs 20.4-nomule)

1. First the bug

start XEmacs, load ite.el
C-x C-f example.tex
M-x ite
C-x o  to switch to ite message buffer window.
C-x b *scratch* to hide the message buffer
C-x o to switch back to example.tex window
h

gives
  Wrong type argument: windowp, nil


Suggested solution: The problem lies in the ite-message

(defun ite-message (s)
  (save-excursion
    (let ((w (selected-window)))
      (setq ite-message-buffer (get-buffer-create "iTe Message"))
      (select-window (get-buffer-window ite-message-buffer))
;(set-buffer ite-message-buffer)
      (goto-char (point-max))
      (insert s)
      (end-of-buffer)
      (select-window w))))

when ite-message-buffer is not displayed in any window
get-buffer-widnow gives nil, which makes select-window barf.
You probably just want some thing like

(switch-to-buffer-other-window (get-buffer-create "iTe Message"))).

The more standard way would be to use (with-output-to-temp-buffer

(defun ite-message (s)
  (with-output-to-temp-buffer "iTe Message"
    (princ s)))

2. ite.el contains a few things that are generaly considered to be bad 
   taste, like messing with debug-on-error, or this....

        (if (equal (nth 2 command-line-args) "ite.el") (ite))

3. Just as suggestion. Since all the magic seems to lie in the in place 
   editing of the dvips output, may I put on the whish list
   a. Make ite a minor mode such that ite can use all the AucTeX magic to
      handle multifile document etc.
   b. Do a away with all the temp files and have Emacs pipe from dvips
      and into gs.

Keep up the good work. Don't let my criticims get to you, they are
meant to be constructive.

I have to go we have a power cut off soon,

%
%The more standard way would be to use (with-output-to-temp-buffer

The problem is that I want that the message window always scrolls to the
end of the buffer. This is not the case by simply defining. The bug is
fixed in the current version 1.1.

%(defun ite-message (s)
%  (with-output-to-temp-buffer "iTe Message"
%    (princ s)))

Remark 2:
% ite.el contains a few things that are generaly considered to be bad 
%   taste, like messing with debug-on-error, or this....
%
%        (if (equal (nth 2 command-line-args) "ite.el") (ite))

I admit this is pretty ugly. It is only needed for the demo, but
I couldn't find a way around it. debug-on-error is only switch on
by users who know what they are doing anyway.

Remark 3:
%   Just as suggestion. Since all the magic seems to lie in the in place

For a) I agree. iTe will handle mulifiles from version 1.2 on(not
before beginning of October). For b), I tried it but it turned out to
be very, very slow to pipe huge junks of PostScript from Emacs to
gs. I don't know where the bottleneck occurs. Therefore I implemented
a file interface instead of pipes. However, it is possible to do away
with all the temp files using some PostSript hacks, given the time.

ANSWER:

Hello,

iTe Version 1.1 is available since yesterday evening.  However,
I uploaded a incomplete version 1.1 already on monday, which you might
have downloaded. So please load the correct version and install it
with the configure script (real easy) after unpacking. If the
configure script doesn't work on your machine, simply replace
the following line in 'ite.in'

(defvar ite-load-path "."
  "Directory from which iTe is loaded. This variable is set by the configure script.")

by the line

(defvar ite-load-path "iTeDirectory"
  "Directory from which iTe is loaded. This variable is set by the configure script.")

where iTeDirectory is the ABSOLUTE path of the directory in which iTe
resides, for example

(defvar ite-load-path "/home/myname/ite"
  "Directory from which iTe is loaded. This variable is set by the configure script.")	
Then rename 'ite.in' to 'ite.el'.
 

Now set in 'ite.el'

(defvar ite-gs-command 
	"gs - -Ic:\gstools\gs5.03;c:\gstools\gs5.03\fonts")

and RESTART Emacs. If you tried exactly this before and it didn't
work, then you have to tell me what went wrong. Also, please don't use
gsview.  Gsview is a previewer and not a PostScript interpreter like
gs. The latter is needed.

I am happy to make this work for you,

Wolfgang

QUESTION


ANSWER

Hello, 

Please put the "-" to the end, i.e.

(defvar ite-gs-command "gswin32 -Ic:\gstools\gs5.03;c:\gstools\gs5.03\fonts -")

Quote use.txt of gs distribution:

    -
                This is not really a switch.  It indicates to Ghostscript
                that the standard input is coming from a file or a pipe.
                Ghostscript reads from stdin until reaching end-of-file,
                executing it like any other file, and then continues
                                                  --------
                processing the command line.  At the end of the command
                line, Ghostscript exits rather than going into its
                interactive mode.

I don't know if the (not) doubling of "\" is the cause, but it might well be.

You might also try

(defvar ite-gs-command "set GS_LIB c:\gstools\gs5.03;c:\gstools\gs5.03\fonts; gswin32 -")

if all fails. Please keep me posted.

QUESTION

Nicolas FRANCOIS wrote

Ok, now I can launch ghostscript (I have added the missing \ and put the
option - at the end of the command line).

The remaining problem is the following : the graphic window is empty ! I
have tried to change the location of the example.ps file, and this is what
I have discovered :

- if I launch the command from the 'execute menu' :
    gswin32 -Ic:\gstools\gs5.03;c:\gstools\gs5.03\fonts example.ps
  with the example.ps file in \gstools\gs5.03, it works.

- if I launch the same command with the example.ps file in /temp, gs shows
a blank result (until there, no problem).

- the attempts to execute ite result in an other blank window.

Well, the problem seems to be that gs doesn't see the file, in a way or an
other.

What can I do more ?

Note : I have tried ite.el under Linux, it works fine, but my Alt key
doesn't work (I have a french keyboard, and the ESC key isn't the right key
for certain functions). Someone works on both platforms ?

ANSWER

Hello,

Ok, suppose you have set

(defvar ite-gs-command 
	"gswin32 -Ic:\\gstools\\gs5.03;c:\\gstools\\gs5.03\\fonts -")

and iTe, at one point, executes

(start-process-shell-command "ite" ite-message-buffer ite-gs-command)

At this point, you should see an empty gs window, because no command
or command line option was issued to load and run a ps file.

At some other point, iTe issues a 

      (ite-select-page 0)

which should display the first page in the gs window. This is done by
the commands ite-write, which writes the page to a temporary file in /tmp,
and ite-run-close, which sends the command to gs to run this file.

If the window stays empty, please set

	(defvar ite-debug-level 1)

and restart Emacs. You will then see some diagnostic output which tells
you the reason why the file couldn't load.

On problem could be that you don't have a /tmp directory on your machine.
In this case, replace /tmp by /temp, or whatever.


Concerning the ALT key: The ESC definitely doesn't work.
Fortunately, you don't need the ALT key much. What I suggest is
the following:
Go to the *scratch* buffer and type in 

	(if (fboundp 'events-to-keys)
	  (events-to-keys (read-key-sequence ""))
          (read-key-sequence ""))C-j

followed by and "ALT uparrow". Here C-j is "Control j".

The result will be something like 

	[M-up]
or
	[(meta up)]

Now replace [(meta up)] in the line

(define-key ite-mode-map [(meta up)]
	  (function (lambda () (interactive) (ite-move 0 1)))))

by whatever you got. Voila, you rebound the key "ALT uparrow".

Unfortunately (for the unresolved problem, not for me) I will now
leave for vacation for 3 weeks (to France). I will check back with you
on my return.

Have a nice time

Wolfgang

Hi.  I'm not sure if this is a iTe bug or an emacs bug, but I thought
you might be interested.

I have the following LaTeX hooks.

(add-hook 'latex-mode-hook 'outline-minor-mode)
(add-hook 'latex-mode-hook 'font-lock-mode)

When I run iTe, the menus that
correspond to outline mode disappear.  When I quit iTe, they don't
come back.

Thanks for iTe. Great program!

Dave Hoover.


ANSWER

Hello,

Thank you for reporting this to me. There is indeed a problem. A      
quick fix is to replace the line

(add-hook 'latex-mode-hook 'outline-minor-mode)

by

(add-hook 'latex-mode-hook '(lambda () (interactive)                  
(outline-minor-mode t)))

With this change the outline menue will not disappear. However, all
text will "show" after quitting iTe.  I will try to fix this in the
next version (1.2) of iTe.

Hello,

The copyright of versions 1.0 and 1.1 was chosen that strict because
at the time I didn't know where the project would go.  Meanwhile it
became clear that a) iTe is much appreciated by many TeX users, and

QUESTION

From: Bruce Foster <bef@nwu.edu>
Subject: iTe 1.1 Problem with make-temp-name in lisp program
Content-Length: 1759
Status: RO

I am trying to install iTe for a general UNIX user situation. I have about
25 machines, all sharing a common file system. Multiple users per machine,
as well as multiple machines.

In reviewing the configuration program, I discovered that the ite.el lisp
program defines a variable named make-temp-name as /tmp/ite. I _assume_
that this means that a file or directory with that name will be created.

That approach is fine for a single-user UNIX system, but it fails if two
people try to use iTe at the same time on the same system. It might fail if
the SAME person tries to use iTe from two sessions at the same time.

It would be best to use a unique file name for this variable. And it would
be a good idea to point out this situation at configuration, because many
systems do not want files created in /tmp by applications programs -- other
filesystems should be used instead.

I don't know enough about emacs and elisp to know how to fix this problem.
The problem is serious enough to prevent me from installing iTe. So I'm
calling your attention to it.

Another configuration question. A path is altered to point to the directory
that ite is configured from. There also seems to be a reference to the file
ite_init.ps. Does that file have to be in the same directory that ite.el
resides in?

I would really like to make iTe available from the emacs site-lisp
directory. If so, what other files have to be put in the same directory?

Thanks for your assistance!

Bruce Foster

There is no problem to run iTe on multi-user platforms. Even a single
user can run several copies of iTe processes, provide each iTe runs
from within a different (X)Emacs session. You assume wrongly that
make-temp-name is a variable, where in fact it is a function.  Given
an input string ("/tmp/ite" for example), it returns a unique file or
directory name starting with, but not equal to, this string.  The
ELisp manual says

 - Function: make-temp-name STRING
   This function generates a string that can be used as a unique
   name.  The name starts with STRING, and ends with a number that is
   different in each XEmacs process.

          (make-temp-name "/tmp/foo")
               => "/tmp/foo021304"

   To prevent conflicts among different libraries running in the same
   XEmacs, each Lisp program that uses `make-temp-name' should have
   its own STRING.  The number added to the end of the name
   distinguishes between the same application running in different
   XEmacs processes.


What (X)Emacs does is to append an id to the string that is derived
from the process id of the currently running (X)Emacs process.

>> many systems do not want files created in /tmp by applications
>> programs -- other filesystems should be used instead.

The next version of iTe (1.2) will first try to create temporary files
in the directory pointed to by the environment variable TMPDIR, then
in '/usr/tmp', then in '/tmp', and then in '.' if all fails. Would
this be working in your setting?  A workaround for version 1.1 would
be to replace the line

 (setq s (make-temp-name "/tmp/ite"))

in ite.el by 

 (setq s (make-temp-name "/usr/tmp/ite"))

for example.

>> Another configuration question. A path is altered to point to the
>> directory that ite is configured from. There also seems to be a

>> same directory that ite.el resides in?

No. Right now the only file that needs to be in 'ite-load-path' is
'ite_init.ps'. The best way to install iTe globally is as follows:

a) Put 'ite.el' to your site lisp directory, for example
'/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp' and append the 'load-path' variable
if necessary.

b) Put 'ite_init.ps' to '/usr/local/share/emacs/etc/ite' and set 
'ite-load-path' to this directory.

c) Put 'ite*.tex' files at a place where TeX will find it, for example
to '/usr/local/share/teTeX-0.4pl8/texmf/tex/generic/ite' if you are
using teTeX, or set your TEXINPUTS environment variable accordingly.

All other files in the distribution are not essential. You may put
them to '/usr/local/share/ite', for example.

QUESTION

j.w.kluwer@filosofi.uio.no (Johan W. Kl|wer)
Subject: iTe suggestion

Dear Mr. Kühn,

I just had the pleasure of putting your iTe package to work on a real
problem, with great success. I really like the concept you have used
in iTe---an elegant use of already available resources!

Now, in the particular case I had to deal with, I did have a problem:
iTe would never stop parsing the postscript file on top of which the
LaTeX material was supposed to go. I tried making tea and looking out
the window, editing the EPS file, nothing worked. The way out for me
turned out to be this: Generate a bitmap from the EPS, substitute that 
bibmap into the text for the iTe run, then put the EPS back into the text.

It seems to me that EPS comes in many qualities, and problems are in
my experience to be expected. The bitmap approach, however, can hardly 
fail. Perhaps this simple workaround should be mentioned in the
manual?

All the best,

ANSWER


Hello,

Yes, an eps document may fool iTe, and especially the longer ones.
The next version of iTe handles eps files differently, and your
problem will probably dissolve. Your approach with the bitmap is
correct.  You can even assist from with your LaTeX code by saying

\DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.b.eps,.eps}

and then say

\includegraphics{foo}.

If the, presumably bit-mapped, file 'foo.b.eps' exists, it is
included.  Otherwise the original 'foo.eps'. This way it is also
possible to include huge eps files inside 'iteblock' environments and
still achieve respond times suitable for interactive use.

Before printing the file, don't forget
to disable this feature, i.e., by

%\DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.b.eps,.eps}

Thank you for your contribution,

Wolfgang Kuehn
