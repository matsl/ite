    <h2>PostScript Error</h2>

    The generated PostScript is corrupt. To solve this
    problem, do the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Generate PostScript code directly using 'dvips'
	with the [dvi] option on.
      <li>Preview the code using 'ghostview' or 'gs'.
      <li>If the error persists, the problem is very likely
	not related to iTe. Check your '\special'
	directives or macros which produce '\special', such
	as PS-Tricks macros.
      <li>If there is no PostScript error, the version of
	'dvips' may be inconsistent with the version of iTe.
      <li>Get the newest version of iTe.
      <li>If your version of 'dvips' is older than 5.58,
	then get a newer version.
      <li>If 'dvips' is of a current release, then you found an iTe bug and should file a bug report.
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Cannot find all iTe objects</h2>
    
    While parsing the (La)TeX source code, not all active iTe objects were found. The most 
    likely reason for this is an inadequate use of the '\ite' directive.
    <ul>
      <li>Do not include naked (not contained in an iteblock
	environment) '\ite' directives from other files via '\input' or
	'\include'. 
      <li>Do not rebind the '\ite' macro.
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Spurious iTe object in (La)TeX source</h2>
    
    While parsing the (La)TeX source, iTe has mistaken
    an inactive iTe object for an active iTe object.
    <p>
      The reasons could be
    <ul>
      <li>You have loaded the iTe package using the 'dvi'
	or 'graphics' option, for example with
	'\usepackage[dvi]{ite}'. In this case, all objects
	are inactive, which is not what you want. Don't use
	these options when running iTe.
      <li>You have used some weird TeX construct, for example
	'\string\ite', for which iTe's parser is too dumb to
	see that the '\ite' directive is not expanded.
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Argument syntax error</h2>
    
    Arguments to an '\ITE' directive is
    corrupt. A correct syntax should look like
    <pre>\ITE(123 123 1.3 -10)</pre>
    for example.
      
    <h2>DVI file outdated</h2>
    
    The dvi-file does not exist or is older than the (La)TeX source file.  Please
    recompile the source before using iTe again.
    
    <h2>Buffer modified</h2>
    
    The buffer with the (La)TeX source was modified
    but not saved. Please save and recompile the source.
    
    <h2>Generating PostScript failed</h2>
    
    iTe was not able to translate the DVI-file into a PostScript file.
    Please see the log-buffer for more details. 
    <p>
      The reasons for failure could be one of
    <ul>
      <li>'dvips' could not be executed, i.e., is not in your search path.
      <li>'perl' could not be executed, i.e., is not in your search path.
      <li>Versions of files in the iTe distribution are inconsistent.
	'ite.el', 'ite.pl', 'ite.sty' and 'ite.ps' must all be of the
	same version.
      <li>iTe was unable to read the (La)TeX log-file.
      <li>You did not load the iTe-package at all. Insert
	'usepackage{ite}' in the header of the (La)TeX source.
      <li>There are no iTe blocks, and thus no active ite objects,
	in the (La)TeX source.
    </ul>
