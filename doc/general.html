<H1>How <span class=ite>iTe</span> works</H1>

<P>
The following L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X2<SUB>e</SUB> code is a minimal working example.

<P>
<PRE>
   \documentclass{article}
   \usepackage{ite}
   \begin{document}

   \begin{iteblock}(5cm,5cm)
   \ite Hello
   \ite World
   \end{iteblock}

   \end{document}
</PRE>
<P>
It defines two <EM>active</EM> <span class=ite>iTe</span> objects (`Hello' and `World').
Upon starting <span class=ite>iTe</span>, active objects can be manipulated interactively.
The possible operations are translation, rotation and scaling. The
origin for these operations is the lower left corner of the box
defined by the <TT>iteblock</TT> environment. For an active object, <span class=ite>iTe</span> 
establishes a one-to-one relationship between its L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X source code
and the corresponding PostScript code fragment.  All operations are
then simultaniously recorded in both the L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X source and in the GhostScript window.  For example, if the `Hello' is translated,
rotated by 90 degrees and scaled by a factor of 2, then the
corresponding L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X source will look like this:

<P>
<PRE>
   \ITE(50 70 90 2) Hello
</PRE>
<P>
Sometimes, you might be pressed to define <span class=ite>iTe</span> objects inside macros
or saved boxes. If this is the case, many PostScript code fragments
may correspond to one L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X source object. Here you have to use
<EM>passive</EM> objects. The use of active objects inside macros and
saved boxes is <B>not</B> checked and will utterly confuse <span class=ite>iTe</span>.
Passive objecst behave like active objects, but cannot be manipulated
interactively. See the definition of the <TT>itebind</TT> <A
HREF="latex.html">latex environment</a> on how to generate passive objects.
