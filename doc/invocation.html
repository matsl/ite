    <P>
      
    <H2>Invoking (X)Emacs commands</H2>
    
    <P>
      If you are not an (X)Emacs beginner, please skip this section.
      
    <P>
      To run an (X)Emacs command by name, start with `M-x', then type the
      command name, and finish with RET.  `M-x' uses the minibuffer to read
      the command name.  RET exits the minibuffer and runs the command.  We
      refer to this process as `M-x cmd', where `cmd' is the command name.
      To produce `M-x' (the Meta-x key), you have to press the Meta-key
      (ALT key) and the x-key simultaneously. As an alternative, you can
      also press the ESC-key, followed by the x-key.
      
    <P>
      
    <H2>Starting <span class=ite>iTe</span></H2>
    
    <P>
      To start <span class=ite>iTe</span>, visit a (La)TeX file which contains active objects (see
      previous section) and compile it. Then run `M-x ite' to start <span class=ite>iTe</span>.
      Note that only one <span class=ite>iTe</span>-process can run in the same (X)Emacs process
      at a time.  If `M-x ite' is invoked recursively, the previous
      <span class=ite>iTe</span>-process is killed automatically.
      
    <P>
      
    <H2><span class=ite>iTe</span> is running</H2>
    <p>
      After start up, the curser jumps to the closest active object. All <tt>\ITE</tt>
      directives are highlighted.
    <p>
      A new GhostScript window appears. On a MS-Windows platform, this window may be iconified, so
      you have to open it.

    <H2>Controlling <B>iTe</B></H2>
    
    <P>
      The focus must be on the (X)Emacs window.
      You can use the middle mouse button to select any other object. Once an object
      is selected, use the <span class=ite>iTe</span> <A HREF="bindings.html">key bindings</A>
      to manipulate the object.  There are also control keys that let you
      navigate in your source code or let you do other tasks such as
      zooming.
      
    <P>
